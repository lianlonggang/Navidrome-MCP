/**
 * Pins the `set_volume` LLM contract: the tool description twice promises that
 * out-of-range levels are CLAMPED (not rejected). The backing schema therefore
 * must accept any finite number and forward it raw to the engine, whose own
 * `setVolume` clamp (playback-engine.setVolume → Math.max(0, Math.min(100, …)))
 * produces the clamped value. A schema regression that re-adds `.min/.max`
 * would turn a documented clamp into a thrown ZodError — a straight contract
 * lie — so we assert here that out-of-range input resolves and reaches the
 * engine unchanged, while non-finite input is still rejected.
