 * Timeout for discovery validation operations.

 * Discovery validates the first N stations IN PARALLEL (see

 * probe, not the sum. The old 2000ms left only 1200ms for the HEAD probe
 * (HEAD_TIMEOUT_RATIO 0.6), which a slow HTTPS/TLS handshake on a non-standard
 * port (e.g. icecast on :8443) blows past, aborting the HEAD before its ICY
 * headers arrive and false-negativing real streams (Issue #7). 3000ms gives the
 * HEAD an 1800ms budget — comfortable headroom for slow TLS handshakes (observed
 * ~800-1100ms standalone) — while capping discovery latency at 3s.
 *
 * NOTE: this does NOT cure every discovery false-negative. Some hosts serve
 * multiple popular streams from one icecast host:port (e.g. walmradio's
 * classic/jazz/jazz_opus all on :8443) and throttle concurrent connections from
 * the same IP, so a parallel batch can still stall a few same-host probes to the
 * timeout. Those streams validate fine one-at-a-time via `validate_radio_stream`
 * — discovery's auto-validation is a best-effort quick sample, not authoritative.
