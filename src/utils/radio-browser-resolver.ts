/**
 * Resolves a working Radio Browser API base URL via SRV record lookup.
 *
 * Per Radio Browser docs (https://api.radio-browser.info/), the canonical way
 * to find a live mirror is to resolve the `_api._tcp.radio-browser.info` SRV
 * record and pick one randomly. Hardcoding `de1.api.radio-browser.info` makes
 * us dependent on a single upstream — when `de1` is in maintenance every
 * radio-discovery tool fails.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   1. If RADIO_BROWSER_BASE env var was explicitly set (i.e. the user picked
 *      a specific mirror) → respect that override, never hit DNS.
 *   2. Otherwise, lazily resolve the SRV record and cache the picked host
 *      for the rest of the process lifetime (1 hour TTL, refreshed on miss).
 *   3. If SRV lookup fails (DNS issues, sandboxed env, etc.) → fall back to
 *      the historical hardcoded `de1.api.radio-browser.info` so we don't
 *      take down radio discovery just because DNS is broken.
 *
 * The result is a plain `https://<host>` base URL — Radio Browser API runs
 * on standard HTTPS port 443 across every mirror, so the SRV port field is
 * informational only.

 * stays the active pick for up to CACHE_TTL_MS — so every subsequent radio
 * tool call fails for the rest of the cache window. Idempotent and cheap.

 * invalidation and re-cache its (now stale) result with a fresh 1h TTL,
