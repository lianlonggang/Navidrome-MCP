/**
 * Minimum gap between consecutive broadcasts triggered by mpv property
 * changes. mpv emits property events at high frequency in two cases:
 *   - `time-pos` ticks ~every 250ms during playback.
 *   - `playlist-count` / `playlist-pos` / `metadata` burst-fire during a bulk
 *     `loadfile` sequence (one event per loaded track — hundreds, for a
 *     "play 500 starred albums" stress test).
 *
 * Without coalescing, each event would trigger a full `buildSnapshot` that
 * runs `getPlayQueue` against a *growing* playlist on every step of a bulk
 * load — gratuitous CPU/IPC churn, and historically the proximate trigger
 * of the 64KB mpv-IPC buffer overflow.
 *
 * 1000ms (1Hz) is fine for the progress bar (the UI interpolates between
 * server values), and is the right ceiling for bulk-load coalescing too.
 *
 * `kind: 'queue'` events (the explicit post-enqueue emit) are NOT throttled
 * — those mark "the user-facing operation is done, the UI should reflect
 * it now." Same for `kind: 'station'` (radio start/stop) and any future
 * non-property kinds.

 * Broadcasts engine state snapshots to a set of SSE clients.

 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `start()` subscribes to the playback engine's onStateChange events.
 *   - `addClient(res)` registers a new SSE response, sends the retry directive,
 *     and pushes an initial snapshot so the UI never sits on a blank frame.
 *   - On disconnect, the response is removed from the active set.
 *   - `stop()` unsubscribes and ends every active SSE response cleanly.
 *
 * Throttling: all property-change events are debounced (leading + trailing)
 * to at most one broadcast per `BROADCAST_THROTTLE_MS`. Non-property events
 * (queue mutations, station start/stop) flush immediately so user-actioned
 * boundaries land in the UI within one frame.
 *
 * Snapshot construction reuses the existing `nowPlaying`, `getPlayQueue`,
 * and `playbackStatus` tool impl functions so the web UI sees byte-identical
 * shapes to what an MCP client would see. Each read is independently
 * resilient via `Promise.allSettled` — one failed read leaves a `null` field
 * on the wire rather than blanking the whole snapshot.
